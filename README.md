# Raspberry Pi Cluster

A portable cluster of Raspberry Pi 4 Model B computers.

Our main focus for this cluster was to process large amounts of data in-parallel through the use of Hadoop and Spark, thus providing distributed storage, greater processing and computing capabilities for Machine Learning models, parallel programming, among others.

# Wiki

Read our [**wiki documentation page**](https://github.com/gitluis/pi-cluster/wiki) to get you started with how to build your very own cluster of small computers.

You can also clone our wiki page locally
```cli
git clone https://github.com/gitluis/pi-cluster.wiki.git
```

Please note wiki page is still under construction.
