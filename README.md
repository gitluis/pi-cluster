# Raspberry Pi Cluster

A portable cluster of Raspberry Pi 4 Model B computers.

## General Usage

A cluster is generally used for distributed computing and processing of large amounts of data in-parallel through the use of Hadoop and Spark, thus providing greater processing capabilities for Machine Learning models, parallel programming, among others.

## Documentation

Read our full [**documentation**](https://github.com/gitluis/rpi-cluster/wiki) page to get you started with your very own cluster of small computers. Here you will find useful information about the Raspberry Pi and how to build a portable cluster of small computer boards. If you believe there is missing information, feel free to add it to the wiki.
