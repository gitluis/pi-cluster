# Software
Raspberry Pi is a small computer that needs an operating system (OS) to operate just like you may probably have a copy of Windows OS installed in your computer. An OS is also software that supports and performs the basic functions of a computer.

There are multiple operating systems that you can install into your raspberry board, however, the official operating system is [**Raspbian**](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). Raspbian is a Debian-based Linux distribution specifically designed and optimized for the low-performance hardware of the Raspberry Pi.

# Third-Party Operating Systems
Third-party OS for the Raspberry Pi are available for download at [raspberrypi.org/downloads](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/).


### I strongly recommend NOOBS or Raspbian
If all of this is new to you, I encourage you to choose NOOBS.
- [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) is an easy operating system installer for beginners.
- [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) is an image of the Raspbian operating system in which the OS is already pre-installed.
