# Install OS

We will install Raspbian operating system into all of our Raspberry Pi boards.

There are two different method(s) to accomplish this OS installation:
1. A clean install of Raspbian into each micro SD card (**recommended**)
1. Install Raspbian once then clone that image across your other SD cards


## Install Raspbian

1. Use our [Installing Raspbian](Installing_Raspbian.md) guide to install Raspbian into an SD card
1. Use our [Software Updates](Software_Updates.md) guide to update and upgrade Raspbian
1. Repeat steps 1-2 for each of your other SD cards


## Clone Image

If you want to install, update & upgrade Raspbian once and then clone that image across your other SD cards, refer to our [Clone OS](Clone_OS.md) guide.
