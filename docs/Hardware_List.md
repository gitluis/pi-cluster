# Hardware List

The following contains a list of required (and optional) hardware components for your cluster.

| Component                         | Quantity | Priority          |
|:----------------------------------|:--------:|:------------------|

| 16 or 32 GB microSD Card          | 5        | Required          |
| USB Wall Charger 2.4A Multi-port* | 1        | Required          |
| USB Type C Cables                 | 5        | Required          |
| 5-Port Network Switch             | 1        | Required          |

| Mouse                             | 1        | Required          |
| Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Heatsinks  | 5        | Optional          |
| Raspberry Pi Cluster Case         | 1        | Optional          |
| 7-inch Computer Monitor           | 1        | Optional          |
| Micro HDMI to Mini HDMI Cable     | 1        | Optional          |

\* The [full specification list](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/specifications/) for Raspberry Pi 4 Model B specifically establish that the board requires a 5V DC via USB-C connector with a minimum of 3A. Yet it also specifies that a good quality 2.5A power supply would do the job if all USB peripherals are kept under 500mA load consumption in total.

I have not had any issues with this, but wanted to share in case your Raspberry Pi board does not power up properly, you may need to verify this.
